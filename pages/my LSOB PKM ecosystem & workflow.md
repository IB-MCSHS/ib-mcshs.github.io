title:: my LSOB PKM ecosystem & workflow

- #Logseq #Obsidian #pkm
- duusad-github.io = my #logseq repository for everything at school.
	- First place I go to
	- this should house other LSOB structures which I copy-paste as required
	- GFF, ECCII & CORE+ work is done here too
- mcshs-ib.github.io = public face of [[MCSHS-IB]] for students and parents
	- staff can also see, of course
	- use as an example for others of PKM/wiki
	- link to school website and Moodle
	- Do I polish and publish this through Obsidian a la Metamechanic?
	- all pages here generally should be created in duusad-github first
		- #publish ?
		- publish:: true? - no, this makes it publishable on _this_ site
